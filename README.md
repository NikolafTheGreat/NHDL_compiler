# NHDL_compiler
A compiler written from first principles for the purpose of exploring the process of compiling digital circuits from a high-level HDL. 

This project was initially written as a bachelor project for a degree in Electrical Engineering at DTU.

## Directory structure

### NHDL_test_files
A series of programs written in NHDL that exemplify language features.

### parser_tests
A series of input programs are used to test the parser. They are here for documentation reasons.

## Upkeep
Despite this being a public repository I do not currently intend to support this project because of future schooling.

There is a possibility of future updates once I get more time. However,  expect the program structure and associated hardware description language will radically change in this case.
